      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was looking at my websites stats and I found a spike in visits coming from search engines.&lt;br /&gt;
It is always good news when something catch search engines attention and traffic get redirected to your website.&lt;br /&gt;
Well actually not always &amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
The keywords used to get to me were definitely a bit OT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name&amp;rsquo;s Ronca, I wrote an article about &lt;a href=&#34;http://massimoronca.it/2014/05/14/writing-custom-commands-for-drush-the-drupal-swiss-army-knife.html&#34;&gt;Drush, the swiss army knife for Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, but this is totally not my line of work :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I love knives and I always carry a small one with me.
My grandfather taught me how to recognize them, he used to be a tailor, but he also lived in the country, so he was competent in the fieldwork and had a superb collection of working knives, like this baby here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine that I would have loved to sell knives, maybe not on TV, I don&amp;rsquo;t really like showing myself to big audiences, but I also seriously think that you guys where looking for this knives, not the metaphorical ones I wrote about&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invite you to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.roncocutlery.com/&#34;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt; and buy everything! those knives look great, as seen on TV!&lt;/p&gt;
