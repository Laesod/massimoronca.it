The other day I was looking at my websites stats and I found a spike in visits coming from search engines.   
It is always good news when something catch search engines attention and traffic get redirected to your website.  
Well actually not always ...   
The keywords used to get to me were definitely a bit OT.

My name's Ronca, I wrote an article about [Drush, the swiss army knife for Drupal](/2014/05/14/writing-custom-commands-for-drush-the-drupal-swiss-army-knife.html), but this is totally not my line of work :)  
  
To be honest, I love knives and I always carry a small one with me. 
My grandfather taught me how to recognize them, he used to be a tailor, but he also lived in the country, so he was competent in the fieldwork and had a superb collection of working knives, like this baby here

I imagine that I would have loved to sell knives, maybe not on TV, I don't really like showing myself to big audiences, but I also seriously think that you guys where looking for this knives, not the metaphorical ones I wrote about
