I present you the result of my weekend project: an [Opal build plugin](https://atmospherejs.com/massimoronca/opal) for Meteor that compiles Ruby files down to Javascript, both on the client and the server.  

Installation is as easy as running  

~~`meteor add massimoronca:opal`~~  

`meteor add mikamai:opal`

Files anding in `.rb` or `.js.rb` will be autoatically compiled and loaded.
  

For those who don't know what Opal is, I reccomend to visit the [Opal website](http://opalrb.org).
